            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>During the holidays between semesters, I started working on a website for the Boys' Brigade.
              Since I have spent many years volunteering for the organization I am familiar with their working process,
              I wanted to use my skills to create something that could be useful while I was in the process of learning.

        <div className='text'>
          <p>This ended up becoming a long project spanning 2 years, combining everything that I have learnt about software engineering
            over my course of study.
